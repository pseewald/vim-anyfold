1. Introduction                                               *anyfoldIntroduction*

Anyfold allows quick navigation and focus in files that are structured by
indentation. Its folding mechanism is generic and works equally well for any
language. Folds based on indented blocks are very useful to reveal the logical
structure of a complex file and to hide irrelevant information.

To get an idea of how it works and why it is so useful, you need to try it
yourself. Nonetheless, here comes a rough description of how folds are defined:
each line followed by a hanging indent starts a new fold. A fold is closed by
the next line with the same indent as the first line of the fold. The actual
indents present in a file are carefully postprocessed to ensure that every fold
contain exactly one logical block of code. Anyfold can handle many corner cases
such as comments, empty lines and varying indentation widths. A fast fold update
mechanism makes sure that folds are in sync with buffer.

2. Usage                                                         *anyfoldUsage*
                                                                 *:AnyFoldActivate*
This plugin needs to be activated by the command :AnyFoldActivate, otherwise it
will do nothing.

To automatically activate vim-anyfold for a specific filetype, add the following
line to vimrc:
    autocmd Filetype <your-filetype> AnyFoldActivate

For dealing with folds in general, see |fold-commands|, |fold-options| and
|fold-behavior|. Additionally, anyfold defines the following mappings:

                                                                *anyfoldMotion*
    [[          Move to the beginning of the current block.          *[[*
    ]]          Move to the end of the current block.                *]]*
    ]k          Move to the end of the previous block.               *]k*
    [j          Move to the beginning of the next block.             *[j*

When a count is used, repeats the command [count] times. Commands can be used
after an operator.

The move commands are very similar to the default fold
motion commands "[z", "]z", "zj", "zk" but they are more intuitive for indented
blocks. More specifically, the first line of a block is defined as the first
line in a fold and the last line of a block as the next line after the last
line in a fold.

Since anyfold can not correctly fold mismatched indentation, auto-indenting
is highly recommended. See |equalprg|.

                                                              *anyfoldIgnore*
By default, anyfold uses the |foldignore| option to identify lines to ignore
(such as comments and preprocessor statements). Lines starting with characters
in |foldignore| will get their fold level from surrounding lines. If
`g:anyfold_fold_comments=1` (see |anyfoldOptions|) these lines get their own
folds.

Note that |foldignore| can not identify multiline comments such as C style
comments or Python doc strings. In order to ignore these cases using syntax
identification, consider setting `g:anyfold_identify_comments` to 2 (see
|anyfoldOptions|). Note that this feature may lead to slow performance for
large files.

3. Configuration and Options                            *anyfoldConfiguration*
                                                             *anyfoldOptions*
For more control over mappings and features, anyfold provides the following
options. These can be set either globally
    let g:<option>=<value>

or filetype specific
    autocmd Filetype <filetype> let g:<option>=<value>

Option                      | Description
----------------------------------------------------------------------
g:anyfold_fold_display      | Minimalistic display of closed folds
g:anyfold_motion            | Map motion commands (|anyfoldMotion|)
g:anyfold_identify_comments | Identify lines to ignore for better fold behavior
g:anyfold_fold_comments     | Fold multiline comments
g:anyfold_comments          | names of syntax items that should be ignored.
                            | Only used if `anyfold_identify_comments=2`.
g:anyfold_fold_toplevel     | Fold subsequent unindented lines

Option                      | Type            | Default value | Explanation   *anyfoldDefaults*
----------------------------------------------------------------------
g:anyfold_fold_display      | 0, 1            | 1 (= 'on')  |
g:anyfold_motion            | 0, 1            | 1 (= 'on')  |
g:anyfold_identify_comments | 0, 1, 2         | 1 (= 'on')  | 1: use |foldignore|
                            |                 |             | 2: use |foldignore| and |synID()| (slow)
g:anyfold_fold_comments     | 0, 1            | 0 (= 'off') |
g:anyfold_comments          | list of strings | ['comment', 'string'] |
g:anyfold_fold_toplevel     | 0, 1            | 0 (= 'off') |
g:anyfold_fold_size_str     | string          | '%s lines'  | Format of fold size string in minimalistic display
g:anyfold_fold_level_str    | string          | ' + '       | Format of fold level string in minimalistic display

                                                                *anyfoldLoaded*
For expert configuration, anyfold triggers an |autocmd-event| `anyfoldLoaded`
after initialisation. This enables user-defined initialisation steps such as
    autocmd User anyfoldLoaded normal zv
which unfolds the line in which the cursor is located when opening a file.
