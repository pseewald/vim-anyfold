# vim-anyfold

Generic folding mechanism and motion based on indentation. Fold anything that is structured into indented blocks. Quickly navigate between blocks.


## Introduction

This Vim plugin comes with the following features:
* Folding mechanism based on indented blocks that has a very intuitive and predictable behaviour (see examples below).
* Results comparable to syntax aware folding methods but fast and generic algorithm that does not rely on language specific rules.
* Works out of the box for any filetypes, optimal results for all indented languages (including properly indented curly brace languages).
* Shortcuts to navigate to beginning / end of a block and to previous / next indented block.
* Can handle corner cases with ease (comments, varying indentation widths, line breaks).
* Fast update mechanism that keeps folds in sync with buffer.

It has the following shortcomings:
* Can **not** correctly fold mismatched indentation and thus should only be used together with disciplined programming style (or in combination with Vim's `equalprg` autoindent feature).


## Advantages over foldmethod=indent

* `foldmethod=indent` only works for indents that are a multiple of `shiftwidth` and thus fails for aligned code lines and inconsistent indentation. Vim-anyfold correctly defines folds for arbitrary indents.
* vim-anyfold recognizes braces as part of indented blocks and correctly folds them. Vim-anyfold thus produces good folds not only for indented languages but also for e.g. C++ or Java.
* vim-anyfold optionally folds multiline comments.

Be aware that `vim-anyfold` is much slower than `foldmethod=indent` and can reduce Vim's responsiveness. This is noticeable only when editing large files.

### Java
Note: this example is outdated since better defaults have been implemented for curly braces.

Examples were recorded using

```vim
let g:anyfold_activate=1
let g:anyfold_fold_comments=1
set foldlevel=0
colorscheme solarized
hi Folded term=NONE cterm=NONE
```


## Setup and usage

1. Install this plugin with a vim plugin manager.
2. Add the following lines to your vimrc (if not already present).

    ```vim
    filetype plugin indent on
    syntax on
    let g:anyfold_activate=1
    set foldlevel=0
    ```

    Choose a higher foldlevel if you prefer to have folds open by default.
3. Use Vim's fold commands `zo`, `zO`, `zc`, `za`, ... to fold / unfold folds (read `:h fold-commands` for more information). Use key combinations `[[` and `]]` to navigate to the beginning and end of the current open fold. Use `]k` and `[j` to navigate to the end of the previous block and to the beginning of the next block.


## Additional remarks

1. *Filetype specific activation:*
    Activate anyfold for a selected \<filetype\> only with

    ```vim
    autocmd Filetype <filetype> let b:anyfold_activate=1
    ```
2. *Supported folding commands:* anyfold uses `foldmethod=expr` to define folds. Thus all commands that work with expression folding are supported.
3. *Fold display:* anyfold's minimalistic display of closed fold assumes that folds are highlighted by your color scheme. If that is not the case, consider installing a suitable color scheme or highlight folds yourself by a command similar to

    ```vim
    hi Folded term=underline
    ```

4. *Lines to ignore*: By default, anyfold uses the `foldignore` option to identify lines to ignore (such as comment lines and preprocessor statements). Vim's default is `foldignore = #`. Lines starting with characters in `foldignore` will get their fold level from surrounding lines. If `anyfold_fold_comments = 1` these lines get their own folds. For instance, in order to ignore C++ style comments starting with `//` and preprocessor statements starting with `#`, set

    ```vim
    autocmd Filetype cpp set foldignore=#/
    ```
    This approach is fast but does not work for e.g. C style multiline comments and Python doc strings. If you'd like anyfold to correctly ignore these lines, add

    ```vim
    let g:anyfold_identify_comments=2
    ```
    to your vimrc. Please note that this may considerably slow down your Vim performance (mostly when opening large files).
5. *Customization:* For expert configuration, anyfold triggers an event `anyfoldLoaded` after initialisation. This enables user-defined startup steps such as

    ```vim
    autocmd User anyfoldLoaded normal zv
    ```

   which unfolds the line in which the cursor is located when opening a file.
6. *Documentation:* For more detailed instructions and information, read the included vim doc `:h anyfold`.


## Options

All options can be either set globally

```vim
let g:<option>=<value>
```

or filetype specific

```vim
autocmd Filetype <filetype> let <option>=<value>
```

Option | Values | Default value |  Description
------ | -------------- | ------------- | ------------
`anyfold_fold_display` | 0, 1 | 1 | Minimalistic display of closed folds
`anyfold_motion` | 0, 1 | 1 | Map motion commands to `[[`, `]]`, `[j`, `]k`
`anyfold_identify_comments` | 0, 1, 2 | 1 | Identify lines to ignore for better fold behavior. 1: use `foldignore`, 2: use `foldignore` and syntax (slow)
`anyfold_fold_comments` | 0, 1 | 0 | Fold multiline comments
`anyfold_comments` | list of strings | ['comment', 'string'] | Names of syntax items that should be ignored. Only used if `anyfold_identify_comments = 2`.
`anyfold_fold_toplevel` | 0, 1 | 0 | Fold subsequent unindented lines
`anyfold_fold_size_str` | string | '%s lines' | Format of fold size string in minimalistic display
`anyfold_fold_level_str` | string | ' + ' | Format of fold level string in minimalistic dispaly

## Complementary plugins

Here is a small list of plugins that I find very useful in combination with vim-anyfold:
* Cycle folds with one key, much more efficient than Vim's built-in folding commands: [vim-fold-cycle](https://github.com/arecarn/vim-fold-cycle)
* Indent based text objects are not (yet) implemented in vim-anyfold, but this plugin works fine (even though blocks are defined in a slightly different way): [vim-indent-object](https://github.com/michaeljsmith/vim-indent-object)
